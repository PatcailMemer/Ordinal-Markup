    <h1>Ordinal Markup<br>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
    Ordinal Markup is the very first Incremental Game that implements ordinals! You might be confused to what are ordinals, but don't worry, we will guide you.
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    When you start this game, you should see a number in the form of H<sub>ordinal</sub>(10) You can click a button to the increase ordinal by 1. The number should go up.
    <br>When your number reach 10, you can maximize the ordinal. Your ordinal will increase to ω, pronounced <i>omega</i>. Omega is the first infinite ordinal.
    <br>After ω, you can increase the ordinal even more, but the number goes up faster. At ω+10, you can maximize to ω2. ω2+10 maximize to ω3 and so on.
    <br>You can also maximize at ordinals like ω+20 → ω2+5 and ω3+100 → ω6+3. At smaller bases like 4, you can maximize ω2+4 → ω3
    <br>At ω9+10, you can maximize to ω<sup>2</sup>, which is omega multiplied by itself. Your number reaches 10240, and you can now Infinity!
    <h2>Infinity</h2>
    When you Infinity, you reset your ordinal, but you gain Ordinal Points (OP) based on your ordinal. You can spend your OP on autoclickers and factors.
    <h3>Autoclickers</h3>
    Autoclickers automate your progress. You can automate adding 1 to your ordinal or maximizing your ordinal. They both cost OP.
    <h3>Factors</h3>
    Factors multiply your autoclicker speed! They cost OP to upgrade. You start with zero factors, but you can do Factor Shifts to gain factors
    <h2>Factors Shifts</h2>
    When you reach the required OP, you can do a Factor Shift. It will reset everything before it, but you gain a new factor and your base decreases by 1.
    <br>Bases are way to reach larger ordinals from smaller ordinals. For example, at base 10, ω<sup>3</sup> requires ω<sup>2</sup>9+ω9+10. In base 4, you only need ω<sup>2</sup>3+ω3+4
    <br>At very low bases, bases can be quite overpowered. You can turn ω<sup>2</sup>2+ω2+3 into ω<sup>ω</sup> in base 3!
    <h2>Base 3 and 4</h2>
    At Base 3 and 4, the game suddenly becomes a lot more grindier. Luckily, there are features that can help relieve the grind.
    <h3>Dynamic Factors</h3>
    At Base 4, you unlock Dynamic Factors. Dynamic Factors act like factors, but they increase over time.
    <br>Your first Dynamic Factor increases by 0.002x per second. You can make it faster by later upgrades in the game.
    <h3>ψ(Ω)</h3>
    When you reach ω<sup>ω<sup>ω</sup></sup>, the game switches to Madore's OCF. At this point, you can buy autoclickers and Infinity to reach larger ordinals!
    <br>When you reach around ψ(Ω<sup>Ω+1</sup>) level, you can do a Factor Boost
    <h2>Factor Boosts</h2>
    Factor Boost gives you Boosters to spend on Boost Upgrades! Your first one gives 1 Booster. The next ones gives 2, then 3, 4, and so on.
    <br>However, the prices increase rapidly, making 4 and more boosters very hard to get
    <h3>Upgrade Table</h3>
    The Upgrade Table is a table of upgrades! They cost boosters to unlock.
    <br>If you want to change your upgrades, you can Refund! Refunding gives you 100% of your boosters back
    <br>The only cost of refunding is that it resets everything in the current Factor Boosts, but you can try a different build.
    <h3>Autobuyers</h3>
    Autobuyers can be bought from the Upgrade Table. They automater higher aspects of the game.
    <br>Max All autobuyer maxes out all autoclickers and factors every second. It stops when you're able to do a Factor Shift.
    <br>Infinity autobuyer performs an Infinity every second, if it can and the ordinal is high enough.
    <br>Autobuyers can be sped up by later upgrades
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    Challenges are the main way to speed up autobuyers.<br>
    When you enter one, you start a new Factor Boost with nerfed effects. All of your upgrades still apply<br>
    You can exit challenges if you don't think you're able to complete the challenges<br>
    You can complete challenges up to 3 times. Each completion has a greater reward.
    <h2>Incrementy</h2>
    Incrementy are objects that grow over time. You need to reach ψ(0) [Madore's] or ψ(Ω) [Buchholz's] in order to start production of them.<br>
    Incrementy give a boost to autobuyers based on their amount. The boost is log<sub>10</sub> (incrementy+10)<br>
    You can also buy Incrementy Upgrades that cost Incrementy. They boost Incrementy-related effects.
    <h2>Manifolds</h2>
    Manifolds are a extension of Incrementy, unlocked with 108 Boosters. In order to gain Manifolds, you must sacrifice Incrementy.<br>
    Manifolds make the Dynamic Factor grow faster based on their amount. The boost is log<sub>10</sub> (manifolds+10)<br>
    There are also 6 new Incrementy Upgrades that have been added. They boost Manifold or Dynamic effects.
